# vue2-flow

`vue2-flow` is a port of the great [`@vue-flow`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow) library for Vue 2.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Early Stage ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a very early-stage version of the library. Please be aware of the following:

- **Limited Packages:** Currently, only the `core` and `background` packages have been migrated.
- **Limited Testing:** Not all features have been thoroughly tested.

Use with caution, and please report any issues you encounter. Contributions are welcome!

## üõ† Setup

```bash
$ npm i @vue2-flow/core

# or
$ pnpm i @vue2-flow/core

# or
$ yarn add @vue2-flow/core
```

## üéÆ Quickstart

In Vue Flow, an application structure consists of **nodes** and **edges**, all of which are categorised as **elements**.

**Each element requires a unique id.**

Nodes additionally need an **XY-position**, while edges require a **source** and a **target**, both represented by node ids.

```vue
<!-- Flowchart.vue -->
<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue"
import { VueFlow } from "@vue2-flow/core"

const nodes = ref([
  { id: "1", type: "input", label: "Node 1", position: { x: 250, y: 5 } },
  { id: "2", label: "Node 2", position: { x: 100, y: 100 } },
  { id: "3", label: "Node 3", position: { x: 400, y: 100 } },
  { id: "4", label: "Node 4", position: { x: 400, y: 200 } },
])

const edges = ref([
  { id: "e1-2", source: "1", target: "2", animated: true },
  { id: "e1-3", source: "1", target: "3" },
])
</script>

<template>
  <VueFlow v-model:nodes="nodes" v-model:edges="edges"></VueFlow>
</template>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure to import the necessary styles:**

```css
/* import the required styles */
@import "@vue-flow/core/dist/style.css";

/* import the default theme (optional) */
@import "@vue-flow/core/dist/theme-default.css";
```

Do **not** scope these styles with `scoped` in your component.
